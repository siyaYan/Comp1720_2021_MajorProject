# Interaction Statement

Write your interaction statement here (max 500 words).
My interaction for the major project mainly is by moving the mouse around to touch or avoid touching different objects in the canvas, and also you click the button or press the certain keyboard to change another scene. Because the theme is about development, and the final outcome would be the success or a better condition. So the interaction part of this work would help or accelerate the process to achieve the final goal. The whole scene is changing all the time, colourful and changeable objects grab the viewer's eyes, and the interaction force viewer to engage in the work and pay more attention to prevent failure.
The devices become more affordable, convenient and flexible, making it easier to create artwork, and a more suitable language or IDE will save more time and energy.
