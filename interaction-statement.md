People can interact with the different scenes with keyboard pressing or mouse operation.
For the first main scene, if you move the mouse on the screen, the solar system will rotate with the mouse movement, and you can drag your mouse to change the position. If you click the sun in the center space, the planets' speed will increase until they achieve the maximum speed, and then double click the sun will reset all planets to their original speed. And also, press the up and down key to zoom in and out to see the solar system. After a certain time, the satellites show off, and if you click the sates, you will go to a different scene.
For the second scene, if you click the center landscape, it will stop rotating, and click again will continue to turn around. If you click the other space on the screen, it will randomly change colour. And if you do a double click, the landscape will change to another form.
