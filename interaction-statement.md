# Interaction Statement

Write your interaction statement here (max 500 words).
The whole scenes last for 200 seconds and will go round and begin again.
The explosion scene lasts 20 seconds, and the dead of the solar system last 30 seconds, then three other scenes last 50 seconds for each. People can interact with the five different scenes with mouse operation, keyboard pressing or mic input.

The following operation can work for all scenes all the time:
1/drag your mouse to change your viewing position.
2/use the mouse wheel or press the up/down key to zoom in and out.

The first explosion scene shows the inside of the sun. It will last 20 sec to present explosions randomly, and the number and the lasting time of the particles will correspond with your sound volume.

The second solar system scene is the main scene, which will last 50sec to show the growth of the sun and its orbits. The bright yellow sun presents the youth stage, and the two satellites show off when the sun matures to red color.

The solar system will rotate with your mouse movement.
If you click in the center space, the sun, the planets' speed will increase until they achieve the maximum speed, and then double click the sun will reset all planets to their original speed. And also, you can speed them up by increasing your sound volume. After the satellites show off, you can change the color by clicking it. (the two satellites are related to the following two scenes)

The third landscape scene shows the growth of the land and city which is placed inside of the satellite.  The first 30 seconds show the growth of the landscape, from the plain to the mountainous region and then to a city. In this stage, you can not change the form of the landscape.
The whole scene can rotate slightly with your mouse. You can click the landscape to change the color, click the cloud and above space to change weather and double-click the landscape to change the form.

The fourth growing tree scene is placed inside of the other satellite.
The first 30 seconds show the growth of the tree, from a small tree to a big one and automatically change its color continuously. In this stage, you can not change the color of the tree but can change its leaves. After 30 seconds, you can click on the screen to change the color and double-click to change the leaves. If you move your mouse to the left or right of the screen, the tree will rotate clockwise or anticlockwise.

The last scene shows the death of the solar system. The orbits will gradually reduce, the satellites disappear, and the sun will shrink and cool down.

Benefit from recent developments in Art and Interaction Computing; 
We can easier obtain different kind of source like click and sound to interact with our artwork, because of the more affordable, convenient and flexible devices like PC. And we can display it to others quickly and do more rapid iterations, because the emerge of the handy platform and easier coding language like P5js.
And also the compatible of hard device and coding, the expanding libraries(like 3Dto2D position library I've used) help us the create art work easier and faster.
