# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 500 words).
My inspiration is from a picture of the Solar life cycle, which makes me think that any life in nature is like a circle and never stops!
Plenty of life is birthing and dying simultaneously, but there is no chance to exist nothingness in the world because there always exists life growing or changing. As the cell reproduction, the growth of a plant, the development of a city and the timeless movement of the universe.
Life never stops! So for me, life itself is the theme of timelessness.

The whole scene changes all the time; colourful and changeable objects, like rotating and moving objects, grab the viewer's eyes.
And the automatic or manual interaction forces viewers to engage in the artwork and pay more attention to the scenes.

With the recent art and interactive computing development, the input and output devices have become more affordable, convenient and flexible, making us easier to create artwork. And more suitable and easy to handle coding languages or IDEs, not only reducing the study time but also saving us more time and energy to create artwork.
