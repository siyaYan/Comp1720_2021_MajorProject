# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 500 words).
My inspiration is from a picture of the Solar life cycle, which makes me think that any life in nature is like a circle; the end connects with the start. Life repeats over and over again, never stops!
So I recognize that the process of life is timeless!
Numerous life is birthing and dying simultaneously, but there is no chance to exist nothingness in the world because there always exists life growing or changing. As the growth of a plant, the development of a city and the timeless movement of the universe. The tree is growing from a seed, and the life of the tree ends with falling seeds to the ground. The city is developed from nature, and one day the city will go back into nature. And in another way, the decline and prosperity of the city are also timeless. The stars and particles in the universe are always birthing and dying, never-ending.

I stimulate three different life cycles to present my understanding of timelessness and mostly focus on the process itself.
From the very beginning is the solar explosion, then the scene moves to the whole universe, which is a macroscopic view about the life cycle. The viewers can see the development of the whole solar system. After that, the field of vision shrinks again to two small planets; the following two scenes describe the life cycle as more microcosmic with city development and plants growing.
In the end, the field of vision expands to the solar system again to observe the death of the solar system.

The whole scene is growing and changing all the time; colourful and changeable objects, like rotating and moving objects, grab the viewer's eyes. And the automatic or manual interaction forces viewers to engage in the artwork and pay more attention to the scenes.

With the recent art and interactive computing development, the input and output devices have become more affordable, convenient and flexible like PC and smartphones, making creating artwork easier and faster. And the connection and compatibility of the hard device and the soft device give us more paths to obtain different sources and make our work more creative and interactive. The handy tool platform, easy to handle coding languages or IDEs(like P5js), and the larger open libraries (like P5 ML library) not only reduce the study time but also save us more time and energy to create artwork.
With the help of these handy tools, we can display it to others instantly, get more feedback, do more rapid iterations and produce a better outcome than in past decades.
